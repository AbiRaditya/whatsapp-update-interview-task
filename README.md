# Welcome to Sphere's Technical Test

Hi there, and thanks so much for taking the time to explore this challenge with us! We’re genuinely excited to learn more about how you think and build. Consider this repository your sandbox—feel free to take notes, experiment, and make it your own as you work through the exercise.

## How to Get Started
- Begin with `docs/interview-task.md`. It walks you through the two parts of the assignment and points you to every resource you’ll need.
- You’ll also find extra context, sample data, and expectations in `docs/interview/candidate-brief.md`.
- Sample inputs (`Whatsapp Data - Sheet.csv`) and patient payloads (`patients-data.json`) live under `docs/interview/` ready for you to use.

## A Few Friendly Notes
- We know interviews can feel intense—take your time, be curious, and call out assumptions when things aren’t clear.
- Clean, well-explained solutions are more valuable to us than rushed perfection.
- If something seems ambiguous, make a reasonable decision and document it. We love seeing how you reason.

## Need Anything?
If questions pop up while you’re working, please reach out to your recruiter or interview coordinator. We’re here to help and want you to feel supported throughout the process.

Good luck, have fun, and we can’t wait to see what you come up with!
